abstract = {Research on unmanned aerial vehicles is growing as they are becoming less expensive and more available than before. The applications span a large number of areas and include border security, search and rescue, wildlife surveying, firefighting, precision agriculture, structure inspection, surveying and mapping, aerial photography, and recreative applications. These applications can require autonomous behavior which is only possible with a precise and robust self-localization. Until recently, the favored approach to localization was based on inertial sensors and global navigation satellite systems. However, global navigation satellite systems have multiple shortcomings related to long-distance radio communications (e.g. non-line-of-sight reception, multipath, spoofing). This motivated the development of new approaches to supplement or supplant satellite navigation. Absolute visual localization is one of the two main approaches to vision-based localization. The goal is to locate the current view of the UAV in a reference satellite map or georeferenced imagery from previous flights. Various approaches were proposed in this area and this paper review most of the literature in this field since 2015. The problematic at hand is analyzed and defined. Existing approaches are reviewed in 4 categories: template matching, feature points matching, deep learning and visual odometry.}

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must keep track of their location in order to maintain flight plans. Currently, this task is almost entirely performed by a combination of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and reference to GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System). Navigation by GNSS, however, is not always reliable, due to various causes both natural (reflection and blockage from objects, technical fault, inclement weather) and artificial (GPS spoofing and denial). In such GPS-denied situations, it is desirable to have additional methods for aerial geolocalization. One such method is visual geolocalization, where aircraft use their ground facing cameras to localize and navigate. The state of the art in many ground-level image processing tasks involve the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We present here a study of how effectively a modern CNN designed for visual classification can be applied to the problem of Absolute Visual Geolocalization (AVL, localization without a prior location estimate). An Xception based architecture is trained from scratch over a &gt;1000 km2 section of Washington County, Arkansas to directly regress latitude and longitude from images from different orthorectified high-altitude survey flights. It achieves average localization accuracy on unseen image sets over the same region from different years and seasons with as low as 115 m average error, which localizes to 0.004% of the training area, or about 8% of the width of the 1.5 × 1.5 km input image. This demonstrates that CNNs are expressive enough to encode robust landscape information for geolocalization over large geographic areas. Furthermore, discussed are methods of providing uncertainty for CNN regression outputs, and future areas of potential improvement for use of deep neural networks in visual geolocalization.},
