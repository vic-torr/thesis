ABSTRACT = {This work explores the combination of free cloud computing, free open-source software, and deep learning methods to analyze a real, large-scale problem: the automatic country-wide identification and classification of surface mines and mining tailings dams in Brazil. Locations of officially registered mines and dams were obtained from the Brazilian government open data resource. Multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, obtained and processed at the Google Earth Engine platform, was used to train and test deep neural networks using the TensorFlow 2 application programming interface (API) and Google Colaboratory (Colab) platform. Fully convolutional neural networks were used in an innovative way to search for unregistered ore mines and tailing dams in large areas of the Brazilian territory. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated by the discovery of 263 mines that do not have an official mining concession. This exploratory work highlights the potential of a set of new technologies, freely available, for the construction of low cost data science tools that have high social impact. At the same time, it discusses and seeks to suggest practical solutions for the complex and serious problem of illegal mining and the proliferation of tailings dams, which pose high risks to the population and the environment, especially in developing countries.},

It provides a taxonomy of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and furnish the reader with knowledge of current and emerging trends in ANN applications research and area of focus for researchers. Additionally, the study presents ANN application challenges, contributions, compare performances and critiques methods. The study covers many applications of ANN techniques in various disciplines which include computing, science, engineering, medicine, environmental, agriculture, mining, technology, climate, business, arts, and nanotechnology, etc. The study assesses ANN contributions, compare performances and critiques methods. The study found that neural-network models such as feedforward and feedback propagation artificial neural networks are performing better in its application to human problems. Therefore, we proposed feedforward and feedback propagation ANN models for research focus based on data analysis factors like accuracy, processing speed, latency, fault tolerance, volume, scalability, convergence, and performance. Moreover, we recommend that instead of applying a single method, future research can focus on combining ANN models into one network-wide application.}

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must keep track of their location in order to maintain flight plans. Currently, this task is almost entirely performed by a combination of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and reference to GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System). Navigation by GNSS, however, is not always reliable, due to various causes both natural (reflection and blockage from objects, technical fault, inclement weather) and artificial (GPS spoofing and denial). In such GPS-denied situations, it is desirable to have additional methods for aerial geolocalization. One such method is visual geolocalization, where aircraft use their ground facing cameras to localize and navigate. The state of the art in many ground-level image processing tasks involve the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We present here a study of how effectively a modern CNN designed for visual classification can be applied to the problem of Absolute Visual Geolocalization (AVL, localization without a prior location estimate). An Xception based architecture is trained from scratch over a &gt;1000 km2 section of Washington County, Arkansas to directly regress latitude and longitude from images from different orthorectified high-altitude survey flights. It achieves average localization accuracy on unseen image sets over the same region from different years and seasons with as low as 115 m average error, which localizes to 0.004% of the training area, or about 8% of the width of the 1.5 × 1.5 km input image. This demonstrates that CNNs are expressive enough to encode robust landscape information for geolocalization over large geographic areas. Furthermore, discussed are methods of providing uncertainty for CNN regression outputs, and future areas of potential improvement for use of deep neural networks in visual geolocalization.},
